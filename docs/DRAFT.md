The gene content of a genome is subject to evolutionary change, with gene duplication and loss the primary drivers of variation in gene family sizes across lineages. Gene family evolution by gene duplication and loss can be probabilistically modeled by phylogenetic birth-death processes (BDPs) [@koonin @hahn2005; @csuros2009], enabling statistical inference of key parameters of the gene family evolutionary process.
